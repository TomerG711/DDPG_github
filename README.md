# Introduction
This repository contains the code release for *Image Restoration by Denoising Diffusion Models with Iteratively
Preconditioned Guidance* (***DDPG***).

**DDPG** can solve various image restoration tasks like Super-Resolution and different kind of deblurring tasks with no need for training.

**DDPG** travers from Back-Projection(BP) based guidance to  Least-Squares(LS) based guidance, making the approach robust
to noise while still having much simpler implementation than alternative methods (***No*** need for *SVD!*).

## Supported degradations

1. Super-Resolution (Bicubic)
2. Gaussian Deblurring
3. Motion Deblurring
